# ASP-Net-Core-Rest-Api-Template-trad-ver
This is a template of Full Crud Rest Api of ASP.NET Core Framework. I would use this as reference in order to see how and what i improved on. Like a memory bank used to check how i improved. I would also use this template for prototyping my own Rest Api depending on situation.  I would put All-in-one functions to this API.

update: I added some DateTime in model class because i dont really like DateTime but in some cases, learning Time is important. i would add some functionalities like using email to send OTP and Probably Semantic Kernel to have AI capabilities. but im still thinking if i have to put it in one api or separate them.
