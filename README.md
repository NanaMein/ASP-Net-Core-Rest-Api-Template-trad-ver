# ASP-Net-Core-Rest-Api-Template-trad-ver
This is a template of Full Crud Rest Api of ASP.NET Core Framework. I would use this as reference in order to see how and what i improved on. Like a memory bank used to check how i improved. I would also use this template for prototyping my own Rest Api depending on situation.  I would put All-in-one functions to this API.
